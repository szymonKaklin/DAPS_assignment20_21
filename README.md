This DAPS (data acquisition and processing) project covers the typical machine learning pipeline up to the stage of data inference. Data is acquired from a variety of data sources, stored, pre-processed, visualized, and then explored. The task is focused on predicting stock price for the company Apple. Apple stock data and general market trends are explored together with google trends data and twitter sentiment. The data inference part of the project is not fully explored.
